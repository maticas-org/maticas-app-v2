# Folder Structure

Absolutely, organizing your TypeScript and React project efficiently is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Let's clarify and propose a more structured approach to organizing your project.

### Proposed Folder Structure

For larger projects, especially those involving multiple pages (views) and possibly a complex state management architecture, a more refined folder structure could significantly improve the project's organization. Here's a structure we might consider:

```
/src
  /assets
    /images
    /styles
  /components
    /common
    /layout
    /ui
  /pages
    Home.tsx
    Login.tsx
    Signup.tsx
    Analytics.tsx
  /services
    authentication.service.ts
    data.service.ts
  /hooks
    useAuth.ts
    useDataFetch.ts
  /context
    AuthContext.tsx
    DataContext.tsx
  /utils
    helperFunctions.ts
  /types
    index.d.ts
  App.tsx
  index.tsx
```

### Explanation

- **/assets**: Store static files like images, icons, and global stylesheets.

- **/components**: For reusable UI elements. This can be further subdivided as needed:

  - **/common**: For very generic components like buttons, inputs, or modals.
  - **/layout**: For layout components such as headers, footers, sidebars, and any layout wrappers.
  - **/ui**: For more specialized UI components that are still reusable but more specific than those in `/common`.

- **/pages**: Contains components that represent entire pages or views in your application. Each component in this folder typically corresponds to a route in your application.

- **/services**: Holds services or APIs for handling external communications, like fetching data from a server or handling authentication.

- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared logic across components or pages.

- **/context**: For React context files, useful for global state management or deeply nested component communication.

- **/utils**: Utility functions and helpers that can be used across the application.

- **/types**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces that are used across the application.

### Benefits

- **Clarity**: This structure makes it clear where to find specific parts of the application, improving navigability for developers.
- **Reusability**: By separating UI components and hooks, you make it easier to reuse logic and UI elements across your application.

- **Maintainability**: Organized codebase helps in maintaining the application, especially as it grows in size and complexity.

- **Scalability**: This structure supports scaling, as new components, services, or pages can be added in their respective directories without cluttering the application.

This is just one way to organize a React + TypeScript project. The best structure depends on the project's size, complexity, and the team's preferences. It's also flexible; feel free to adjust it as your project evolves.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: "latest",
    sourceType: "module",
    project: ["./tsconfig.json", "./tsconfig.node.json"],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
};
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
